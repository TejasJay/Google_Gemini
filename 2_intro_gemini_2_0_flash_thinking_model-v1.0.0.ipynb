       "(Math.round(radius/pixelsPerMile * 10) / 10).toFixed(1);\n",
       "```\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **`radius / pixelsPerMile`**: This divides the `radius` by `pixelsPerMile`.  This likely converts a radius value (in some unit, perhaps pixels initially) into a distance in miles (or a representation related to miles). Let's assume `pixelsPerMile` is a conversion factor indicating how many pixels represent one mile.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **`... * 10`**: The result from step 1 is multiplied by 10.\n",

       "\n",
       "5. **`.toFixed(1)`**: This converts the numerical result to a string and formats it to have exactly one decimal place. Even if the number is a whole number after the previous steps, `.toFixed(1)` will ensure it's displayed with `.0` (e.g., `5` becomes `\"5.0\"`).\n",
       "\n",
       "**Purpose:**\n",
       "\n",
       "The code essentially calculates a distance (or a value representing a distance in miles, scaled and potentially related to pixels), rounds it to one decimal place, and then presents it as a string with one decimal place.

       "return formattedMiles;\n",
       "```\n",
       "\n",
       "This version is much more verbose, but each step is clear.  You could condense it a bit while still improving readability:\n",
       "\n",
       "```javascript\n",
       "const milesValue = radius / pixelsPerMile;\n",
       "const roundedMiles = Math.round(milesValue * 10) / 10;\n",

       "**Which \"Simplification\" to Choose?**\n",
       "\n",
       "* **For best readability and maintainability, especially in larger projects:**  Using intermediate variables (like in option 1) is often preferred.  It makes the code easier to understand and debug.\n",

       "* **For keeping it concise and if readability is already acceptable:**  The original code is quite good. Option 3 is a tiny bit more organized but very similar to the original.\n",

       "\n",
       "All these variations perform essentially the same calculations. The performance difference between them will be negligible in almost all real-world scenarios.  Readability and maintainability are far more important than micro-optimizations in code like this.\n",

       "**Question: The Yo-Yo on an Incline**\n",
       "\n",
       "A yo-yo, modeled as a uniform solid cylinder of mass *M* and radius *R*, starts from rest and rolls down an incline that makes an angle *θ* with the horizontal. The yo-yo unwinds as it descends, and a string is attached to the top of the incline, ensuring pure rolling motion (no slipping).  Assume the string remains taut and parallel to the incline.\n",
       "\n",
       "**(a)** Draw a free-body diagram of the yo-yo as it rolls down the incline. Label all forces acting on the yo-yo.\n",
       "\n",
       "**(b)**  Using Newton's laws, derive expressions for:\n",
       "    **(i)** The linear acceleration *a* of the center of mass of the yo-yo down the incline.\n",
       "    **(ii)** The tension *T* in the string.\n",
       "    **(iii)** The angular acceleration *α* of the yo-yo about its center of mass.\n",
       "\n",
       "**(c)**  Using energy conservation principles, derive an expression for the speed *v* of the center of mass of the yo-yo after it has descended a vertical height *h*.  Assume the yo-yo starts from rest.\n",
       "\n",
       "**(d)**  Compare the linear acceleration of the yo-yo down the incline to the acceleration of a block of the same mass *M* sliding frictionlessly down the same incline. Explain the difference in terms of energy or forces.\n",
       "\n",
       "**(e)**  If the yo-yo is released from rest at a height *h*, what is the work done by the tension force as the yo-yo descends to the bottom of the incline (vertical height *h*)? Explain your reasoning.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "**Key Concepts Tested:**\n",
       "\n",
       "* **Free-Body Diagrams:** Essential for force analysis.\n",
       "* **Newton's Second Law (Linear and Rotational):**  Applying ΣF = ma and Στ = Iα.\n",
       "* **Torque:** Understanding how forces cause rotation, and calculating torque.\n",
       "* **Moment of Inertia:** Using the moment of inertia for a solid cylinder (I = 1/2 MR²).\n",
       "* **Rolling without Slipping Condition:** Relating linear and angular acceleration (a = αR).\n",
       "* **Energy Conservation:** Applying conservation of mechanical energy including both translational and rotational kinetic energy, and potential energy.\n",

       "* **Start with the free-body diagram.** Clearly identify and label all forces acting on the yo-yo.\n",
       "* **Apply Newton's Second Law separately for linear and rotational motion.**\n",
       "* **Remember the condition for rolling without slipping: a = αR.** This is crucial for linking linear and angular variables.\n",
       "* **For energy conservation, consider all forms of mechanical energy:** translational kinetic energy, rotational kinetic energy, and gravitational potential energy.\n",
       "* **Think carefully about the direction and point of application of each force when calculating torques.** Torque is about rotation around a point (the center of mass in this case).\n",
       "* **For part (e), consider the point of application of the tension force and the displacement of that point.**\n",
